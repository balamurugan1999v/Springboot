Springboot

What is springboot:
	Springboot is java based spring framework used in Java web application
	It is used to build microservice based application
	It is used rapidly build the application with less no of configurations
	It is having build in servers like tomcat and jetty.
	
What is the advantage of Springboot over Spring:
	Auto configuration - Spring boot automatically configures the jar dependencies which is in the classpath of the project.
	@EnableAutoConfiguration - is the annotation used of this
	It is automatically configure the default error page, dispatcher servlet, datasource and configure webjars
	
Annotations:
	@SpringBootApplication - This annotation used in the main class of the application.
		It encapsulates @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.
	
		Example:
		@SpringBootApplication
		public class DemoApplication{
			public static void main(String args[]){
				SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
			}
		}
		
	@SpringBootConfiguration - 
		It is the automated version of @Configuration annotation in Spring.
		In Most of the SpringBoot application using this feature via @SpringBootApplication annoatation.
	
Important topics I want to understand
`	1. Bean - It is an object managed by Spring Inversion Of Control(IOC) container. IOC is responsible for initialing, assemblibg and running the Bean.
		Bean lifecycle
		Bean scope
		Bean factory
		
	2. Configuration -  It is used to configure the dependencies which is present in the project classpath
	3. ComponentScan - 
	4. How to connect to H2 database by using springboot default H2 DB.
		Add the h2 depedency in pom.xml 
			<dependency>
				<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
				<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
				<scope>runtime</scope>
			</dependency>
		Add the datasource URL, username, password, driver in application.properties
			#H2 Database
			spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:sampledb  -- Here sampledb is the db name
			spring.datasource.driverClassName = org.h2.Driver 
			spring.datasource.username = sa
			spring.datasource.password = pass - It is the password, we can create as required.
			spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
			spring.h2.console.enabled=true -- If it is enabled then we can see the database console.  Link will be http://localhost:portNumber/h2-console
	5. Dependancy Injection
	6. IOC
	7. Dispatcher Servlet
		It is used when we receive a request and serve it to the respective controller.
	8. Spring IOC Container:
		- It is implementing the IOC framework.
